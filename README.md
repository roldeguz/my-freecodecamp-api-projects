FreeCodeCamp: Timestamp Microservice
=========================

- I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).
- If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
- If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.

Usage: 
> - https://roldeguz-ts-microservice.glitch.me/June%2022,%202017
> - https://roldeguz-ts-microservice.glitch.me/1498089600

Output: 
> { "unix": 1498089600, "natural": "June 22, 2017" }
